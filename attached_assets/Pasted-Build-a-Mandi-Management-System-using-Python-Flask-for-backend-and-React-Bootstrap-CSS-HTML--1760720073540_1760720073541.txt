Build a Mandi Management System using Python (Flask) for backend and React + Bootstrap + CSS + HTML for frontend.
The system should manage merchants, farmers, and daily vegetable trading with bill generation, merchant credit management, and adhatiya (commission) income tracking.
Keep the UI simple but visually clean using Bootstrap styling.

⚙️ Technologies to Use

Backend: Python Flask

Frontend: React (JSX), Bootstrap, CSS, HTML

Database: SQLite (local, lightweight)

Printing: Browser print view from React (printable bill)

🧮 Backend (Flask) Structure

Use Flask Blueprints for modular structure:

/auth → login/register

/bills → create/edit/delete/list bills

/merchants → manage merchants, credit entries

/farmers → daily farmer summary

/income → adhatiya commission tracking

Models:

User, Merchant, Farmer, Vegetable, Bill, BillItem, Transaction, AdhatiyaIncome

Automatically calculate:

Bill totals

Merchant commission

Income tracking

Use SQLite locally with proper relationships (SQLAlchemy ORM).

🎨 Frontend (React + Bootstrap)

Basic React components for each section (Login, Bills, Merchants, Farmers, Income, Profile).

Use Bootstrap tables, forms, modals, and cards for neat appearance.

Use Axios for API calls to Flask backend.

Include responsive design for desktop and tablet.

Implement a printable bill page using window.print() and styled with Bootstrap.

🎯 Goal

Fully working local system (Flask backend + React frontend).

Easy management of daily mandi operations:

Bill generation

Merchant tracking

Farmer records

Adhatiya income

Looks neat with Bootstrap and minimal CSS.

Focus on correctness, readability, and complete CRUD operations for every module.
